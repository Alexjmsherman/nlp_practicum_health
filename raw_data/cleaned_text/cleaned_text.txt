the universal features of the histopathology of fibrotic lung disease are derangement of parenchymal collagen and infiltration of the parenchyma with chronic inflammatory cells
data from patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with pulmonary fibrosis other than idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis patients with nonfibrotic lung disease and normals demonstrated that circulating lymphocytes from more than of patients with fibrotic lung disease take part in processes where the recognition of collagen results in migration_inhibition factor production and lysis of collagen coated sheep red blood cells
collagen induced migration_inhibition factor production and cytotoxicity were found in less than of patients with nonfibrotic disease and were not found in normals
circulating lymphocytes from patients with fibrotic disease are present in normal to ratio
these in vitro observations suggest that circulating lymphocytes and lung collagen may be intimately associated in the pathogenesis of human fibrotic lung disease

detection of canine batten disease with the eeg
although it has been suggested that eeg changes appear early in the course of human batten disease these observations have been made only after the onset of clinical abnormalities and without immediate pathological correlation
in this brief report we have been able to document for the first time abnormal eegs in strain of dogs proposed as model for batten disease
the degree of abnormality in the canine eeg correlated with the degree of clinical involvement and with the presence of pathological inclusions resembling those seen in human batten disease
in younger dogs abnormal eegs were obtained even before clinical_manifestations of the disease
the large amplitude discharges reported with photic stimulation in children with the late infantile form of batten disease were not elicited in the dog model
however this dog strain is model for the juvenile rather than the late infantile form although similarities between dogs and both forms of human batten disease were seen
it is proposed that the eeg is both method for early detection of this disease as well as tool ot measure the degree of involvement
all of out seven_patients suffered from convulsive disorder
the transformation response revealed dependence on the stage course of the disease and regime of therapy during the tests with unspecific specific and tumorspecific antigens
the results for the prognosis of the disease and the transformation rates depending on the age of disease and the cell type are identical
the phenomenon may be explained by lymphatic stem cells in the blood or an ontogenetically higher content of embryonic tissue respectively being present as unspecific stimulant or an immunological defence reaction against maternal immunoglobulins transmitted diaplacentally formation of factors or against maternal lymphocytes to prevent runt disease

all patients regardless of the stage of the disease had high titres of anti measles antibodies in sera and the antibody activity was associated with both the igm and the igg classes of immunoglobulins
further studies in two families suggest that genes are involved in the pathogenesis of the disease each associated with separate metabolic defect
when both these haplotypes were found together as in the propositus and one sibling in the first family investigated all the signs of the fully developed disease were apparent
the concomitant inheritance of these two genes and the metabolic defects they determine are required for the full development of the disease

sarcoidosis and whipple_disease association relation
on the basis of personal case in which two successive diagnoses of sarcoidosis and whipple_disease were made at an interval of four years the authors discuss the possible association or relationship between these two disorders both diffuse affecting the reticulo histiocytic system and diagnosed on histological basis
review in the literature of cases of whipple_disease with pleuro pulmonary lesions makes it possible on the one hand to associate with the latter numerous examples of extra intestinal involvement the histological appearance of which of non specific epithelioid granuloma does not indicate the diagnosis during the long pre intestinal phase and on the other hand to explain that during this period the presence of pleuro pulmonary lesions leads to an initial diagnosis of the probability of sarcoidosis
the practical consequences are as follows the appearance of intestinal signs during sarcoidosis should lead to intestinal or mesenteric node biopsy to seek the macrophages with highly pas positive cytoplasm characteristic of whipple_disease

ventricular premature beats and anatomically defined coronary_heart disease
ectopic activity persisted for at least of the hours in of the patients with coronary_heart disease of with other heart_disease and in of normal_subjects
the prevalence and grade of ventricular premature beats were increased in the patients with multivessel disease compared with values in the patients with one vessel disease less than
for the individual patient the prevalence and grade of ventricular ectopy may not always correlate with the severity of coronary_artery disease or degree of left_ventricular dysfunction
intraarterial sound was measured just distal to the aortic and pulmonary valves of subjects with no apparent valve disease
pulmonary_vascular disease after systemic pulmonary_arterial shunt operations
of these patients were studied to assess the presence of pulmonary_vascular disease and the time of its occurrence after surgery
they were selected either because lung tissue was available for histologic grading of pulmonary_vascular disease patients or because hemodynamic studies were performed after the shunt operation patients
after subclavan pulmonary_arterial shunt patients there was little evidence of advatients pulmonary_vascular disease in either histologic of patients or hemodynamic of patients studies
after an aortic pulmonary_arterial shunt waterston potts there was small likelikhood of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease with shunt duration of less than years of histologic of hemodynamic studies
with shunt duration of more than years the incidence of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease increased significantly of histologic of hemodynamic studies
mean pulmonary_arterial pressure of mm hg or greater strongly suggests the presence of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease
when systemic pulmonary_arterial shunt has provided effective palliation with decreased pulmonary pressure there is small likelihood that advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease will develop even with long shunt duration of to years
pulmonary_vascular disease in complete canal defect
the incidence and time of occurrence of pulmonary_vascular disease were studied in children with the complete form of canal defect
advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease begins to develop during the first year of life with intimal fibrosis grade cahnges noted between age months to year
these changes can be found in some patients in spite of hemodynamic findings usually considered to indicate lesser degrees of vascular_disease
after age years advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease is commonly found and may persist after surgical correction of the defects
similar rapid progression of pulmonary_vascular disease was noted in children who had large ventricular_septal defect without canal in whom systemic pressure was transmitted directly to the pulmonary_vascular bed
no difference was noted in the speed of progression of pulmonary_vascular disease between these children and those without trisomy
palliative or corrective surgery should be performed in these patients by age year to prevent development of advanced_pulmonary vascular_disease

tissue culture studies in hodgkin_disease morphologic cytogenetic cell surface and enzymatic properties of cultures derived from splenic tumors
monolayer and suspension cell cultures prepared from hodgkin_disease tumors in the spleen were examined microscopically and by cytogenetics tested for lymphocyte and monocyte cell surface properties and assayed for enzymes by histochemical and techniques
hodgkin_disease monolayer cultures were composed of rapidly proliferating round and polygonal cells that were capable of propagation in vitro for an indefinite period of time
abnormal aneuploid chromosomes were found in short term hodgkin_disease monolayers that had been passaged times and in established cell_lines carried in culture longer than yr and passaged more than times
cells fromhodgkin disease monolayers contained lysozyme muramidase fluoride resistant alpha naphthol acetate esterase acid and alkaline_phosphatase and chymotrypsin like activity
suspension cultures derived from hodgkin_disease monolayers were composed of cells with aneuploid karyotypes and similar enzymes
the hodgkin_disease suspension culture cells had surface receptors for complement and iggfc lacked surface or cytoplasmic immunoglobulin and did not form erosettes react with an antithymocyte serum nor exhibit phagocytosis
the morphologic cytogenetic cell surface and enzymatic findings indicate that our hodgkin_disease monolayer and suspension cultures are composed of cells with many properties suggesting an origin from monocytes macrophages rather than lymphocytes or fibroblasts
the presence of aneuploid karyotypes is consistent with neoplastic origin and derivation from malignant cell of hodgkin_disease

renal_tubular dysfunction in minamata disease detection of renal_tubular antigen and beta microglobin in the urine
minamata disease was found among the residents along minamata bay contaminated with the effluent from an industrial plant using mercury
evidence is described of renal_tubular dysfunction associated with this disease by the immunochemical demonstration or renal_tubular epithelial antigen and beta_microglobulin in the urine
nineteen patients with minamata disease and diseased and healthy control_subjects were examined
the contents of urinary renal_tubular epithelial antigen and beta_microglobulin and the ratios of these proteins to albumin in individuals with minamata disease were significantly different from the levels in healthy control_subjects less than were identical to those found in patients with tubular and the values proteinuria
these results_indicate that minamata disease is associated with renal_tubular dysfunction and also suggest that these procedures would be useful for screening the nephrotoxicity in the environmental exposure of heavy metals

significant decrease in em was found in children with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia and in children with solid tumours thus giving false negative rate in malignant disease of as compared to false positives among children with non_malignant disorders of the later false positive patients had autoimmune disease
results of the em test in the children with leukaemia were compared with those in patients with non_hodgkin lymphoma and with hodgkin_disease at different stages but no striking change was seen between different diseases or after cessation of long_term chemotherapy
these results_indicate that patients with lymphoid malignancies still have lymphocytes which had been sensitized by common antigen of the malignant cell clone at the beginning of the disease
the em test furthermore could serve as an additional diagnostic aid in differentiating benign from malignant masses in the abdomen extremities or intracranial disease
with such rare disease it would be of help to centralize the treatment of these patients as much as possible

histochemical comparison of the epithelial mucins in the ileum in crohn_disease and in normal_controls
comparison of routine and special histochemical methods that were applied to the epithelial mucins of small_intestine from patients_with_crohn disease and from normal_controls showed that the normal small_intestine ileum goblet cells secrete predominantly non sulphated sialomucin and that in to the colon the neuraminidase insensitivity of the sialic acids of the small_intestine was not due to either acylation at or an ester substituent at
presumably this implies that the protection against enzyme attack afforded to the mucosa by the mucin coat in the small_intestine utilises different mechanism from that in the colon and that although in many respects the small intestinal mucins in crohn_disease and in normal_controls are similar there is an increase in side chain acylated sialic acids in such mucins in crohn_disease

the various aspects of this disease and in particular the most recent diagnostic methods are examined and therapeutical possibilities from the medical and surgical standpoint are discussed
it is possible that these differences are related to the various phases in the course of the disease and that oligoclonal disturbation is marker of the auto immune phase
none of the single manifestations is in itself specific or pathognomonic for this disease except for the disturbance of the metabolism of phytanic_acid
therefore clinical syndromes that involve similar manifestations without accumulations of phytanic_acid should not be included under the term heredopathia atactica or refsum_disease
whatever the biochemical mechanism that links phytanic_acid accumulation with the clinical_manifestations of heredopathia atactica it appears that the observations made on patients following successful dietary treatment leave little doubt that most if not all of the manifestations in this disease are caused in some way by the accumulation of phytanic_acid

the primary disease occurs only once in any individual life and is caused by transmission of virus from an already infected human
thereafter the individual may be subject to recurrent herpetic disease the manifestations of which are different from the primary disease
recurrent disease varies in severity from trivial to incapacitating and frankly lethal as in diseases resulting from the virus neurotropic and oncogenic properties
the source of the virus in recurrent herpetic disease has never been conclusively resolved but is almost certainly endogenous to the patient

the disease occurs only in persons who lack antibody to this virus and serologic findings during the acute illness provide almost certain evidence for its etiologic association
the clinically relevant antibodies which develop during the disease other than heterophile antibody are those against the viral capsid antigen
the serologic hallmark of the disease is the presence of heterophile antibody
in one quarter of the families all examined first degree relatives of the proband were normolipidaemic and thus the disorder was classified as non genetic
multiple type combined familial hyperlipidaemia could be demonstrated in families and single type iib or iv familial disease was found in instances

huntington_disease serum had no demonstrable effect on electron spin resonance parameters of protein specific spin label attached to membrane proteins in control erythrocytes compared to the effect of control serum
this finding suggests that under the conditions employed no serum component or circulating factor is responsible for the changes in the physical state of membrane proteins in huntington_disease erythrocytes butterfield oeswein and markesbery nature
no alteration in lipid fluidity of huntington_disease erythrocyte membranes could be discerned suggesting that the underlying molecular defect in huntington_disease involves membrane protein
the results of the present studies on erythrocytes strongly support the concept that huntington_disease is associated with generalized membrane abnormality

serum high_density lipoproteins in peripheral_vascular disease
high_density lipoprotein_cholesterol has been measured by the autoanalyzer and apolipoproteins ii and by an immunochemical method in patients with peripheral_vascular disease and in age and sex matched controls with an approximately similar prevalence of hyperlipidaemia
further analysis of the data showed low levels to be related to the presence but not to the severity of the arterial disease and to be independent of concurrent hyperlipidaemia and smoking habits
it is therefore suggested that studies relating serum to arterial disease may be more informative if both the lipid and protein portions of these lipoproteins are measured

severe cerebral disturbance in legionnaires_disease
in two cases of legionnaires_disease pneumonia was associated with severe cerebral disturbance
in one case legionnaires_disease was diagnosed retrospectively by serological methods and in the other the development of similar cerebral symptoms in the course of pneumonia prompted clinical diagnosis of legionnaires_disease and the institution of effective treatment
the serum thus seems to be of value in the assessment of liver_disease but not in patients with gastric or colonic symptoms or iron deficiency anaemia
concentration of cytoplasmic rna in the endometrium in trophoblastic_disease
the method of was used to determine quantitatively the content of cytoplasmatic rna in cells of endometrial glands in females who suffered trophoblastic_disease
it was found that during the first year after the disease the rna content in the endometrium in patients subjected to chemotherapy was nearly twice as low as in females not treated with methotrexate
within the same period the rna content was mostly low in those who suffered malignant forms of the disease and were injected larger doses of the substance accordingly
if the duration of the disease was longer than year the rna content in the endometrium in both methotrexate treated and not females proved to be nearly the same in the former the content being reliably higher than the analogous value in the control group females in phase of normal menstrual cycle secretion not suffering hydatid mole
